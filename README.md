# Sorts
Implementation of some sorts in CS32. Made these during class.

## Sorts

Sorts are important. When we're using a data structure with no inherent order, we need an O(nlogn) algorithm to actually make it efficient.
For large scale networks and information, this is key!

Check these sorts benchmarks out:
